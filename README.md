  # Thee Social Network... but only the API

  [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-green)](http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

  ## Description
  This project is an example of an API that could be used for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. An intended user story could be as follows:

    ```md
    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
    ```

  Technologies Utilized:
  For this project we utilized [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for the routing and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages. [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) was used to better format our creation timestamps for readability purposes.
